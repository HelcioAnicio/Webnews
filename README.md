## My process
### Built with

- HTML custom elements 
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned on this project how to divide the page with a content and a image without distort it.

```HTML
    <form class="form" action="">
        <input type="email" id="email" name="email" placeholder="seuemail@seuemail.com">
        <button type="button"><img src="./assets/send.svg" alt="Enviar"></button>    
    </form>
```
```CSS
.right > img {
    width: 100%;
    height: 100%;
    object-fit: cover;
}
```

### Continued development

I'll learn how to use a form on html and it can useful for the page.
